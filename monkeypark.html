									<p> Located on Mt. Arashiyama, Monkey Park Iwatayama is a natural habitat for Japanese macaques, also known as snow monkeys. Visitors can hike up to the park through a picturesque forest trail that takes about 20-30 minutes. At the top, you'll find yourself surrounded by wild but accustomed monkeys roaming freely. There are feeding areas where you can interact with the monkeys while adhering to specific guidelines to ensure their well-being. The park offers stunning panoramic views of Kyoto city and the Katsura River, making it a popular spot for both nature lovers and photographers.</p>
									<blockquote>
										: Remember, these are wild Japanese macaques, not pets. Observe them from a distance and avoid loud noises or sudden movements that could startle them.There's a designated feeding area with food pellets available for purchase. Avoid feeding the monkeys anything else, as human food can be harmful to them.
