									<p> Castle is located in the Nakagyo Ward of Kyoto, Japan. it is a historic site with rich cultural significance. Nijo Castle was built in 1603 as the Kyoto residence of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first shogun of the Edo Period (1603-1867). The castle is an excellent example of feudal-era architecture and played a significant role in Japanese history. It was the site where the last shogun, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, returned sovereignty to the Emperor in 1867. This is the main building of Nijo Castle and is famous for its beautiful interiors. It consists of multiple interconnected buildings with elegantly decorated rooms featuring tatami mat floors and sliding doors (fusuma) with paintings. In 1994, Nijo Castle was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the "Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto."
