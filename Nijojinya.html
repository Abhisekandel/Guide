									<h3 class="major">About</h3>
									<p> Next to Nijo Castle, the Ogawa family has resided in this designated National Treasure for many centuries, when it operated as an inn for feudal lords visiting Kyoto. The 17,600 sq. ft., Sukiya-style residence contains 24 rooms. Due to the fact that the visitors of Nijo Jinya were the richest and most influential individuals in feudal Japan, security was of utmost importance. The residence is equipped with multiple tools to outwit deceitful burglars. Between cupboards there are concealed spaces, hallways have low ceilings to prevent sword fighting, blind staircases are surrounded by dogleg hallways to trap enemies, bodyguards have soundproof hiding spots, there are secret escape routes, a staircase is suspended from the ceiling, closets have hidden exits, valuables and documents can be hidden, and areas have good acoustics for guards to eavesdrop on conversations. A rice exchange traded rice for money during a time when samurai were paid in rice and wheat. The exchangers had full economic control over the samurai as they determined the rate of exchange between rice and money.</p>
									<blockquote>Nijo Jinya is a private residence, not a typical museum.  Tours are required and must be booked by phone in Japanese (no online booking available). Consider having your hotel or a guide service assist with the reservation process. Tours are offered at specific times, so plan your visit accordingly.</blockquote>
